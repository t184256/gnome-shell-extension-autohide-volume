# Autohide Volume

## Why

I'm not interested in the fact my output audio device is muted:
this is how it's supposed to be.
But if it's unmuted, then I want to see the icon.

Except when the mic is on,
then I'm probably in a call,
frantically figuring out what's wrong.

## What

This is a trivial GNOME extension to autohide the volume icon when:

1. the stream is muted
2. the microphone capture icon is also hidden
